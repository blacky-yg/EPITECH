# Project Week B-EPI-300

## UNIT DESCRIPTION

This unit will enable you to work in groups, made up of students from different schools, on a joint project. 

The similarities in your profiles will be closer to business world situations and will foster as much creation and innovation as they will encourage enriching discussions.   This project will also create windows of opportunity for the intersecting skills that will be necessary in your future professions.

Once the projects have been presented, a number of them will be selected for a second week, which will, in turn, enable a project Bootstrap, which will be followed by a final jury. 

1 credit for participation in the first stage of the project, 2 more credits if students participate in second stage and 1 final credit if students are selected to participate to the national contest.
