# B-DOP-400

## UNIT DESCRIPTION

> This module is the first of a series of 2 modules, the DevOps track, in which you will learn the ins and outs of the DevOps ecosystem, with a great tour of the technologies used in this modern popular software engineering movement.

> This module will be followed next year by the B5 - Advanced DevOps module, where you will discover a final technology and conclude with an important end project, blending all the previous projects and notions together in one final, epic, challenge.

## TOPICS TO BE COVERED

> In this module, you will be introduced to two notions and their associated technologies, with the following projects:

> - Popeye (containerization with Docker)

> - my_marvin (automation with Jenkins)

> All the notions and technologies you will see in this module will be useful for your other projects, and will help you be more efficient and successful with them.

## SKILLS TO BE ACQUIRED

- Creating and managing a set of Docker images and containers using Dockerfiles and Docker Compose
- Setting up a Jenkins instance for Continuous Integration and various automation tasks (such as automated testing) using Jenkins Configuration as Code and Jenkins Job DSL
