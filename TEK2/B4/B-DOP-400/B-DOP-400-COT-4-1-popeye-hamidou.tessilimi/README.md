# Popeye

## DESCRIPTION

>  This first DevOps project will introduce you to one of the most important notions of DevOps: containerization.
You will learn how to use one of the leading associated technologies on the market: Docker.
You will create several images using Dockerfiles and coordinate their creation and deployment using Docker Compose.
In the end, with a simple one-line command, you will be able to deploy a fully containerized set of applications together, anytime, anywhere, without the need to switch between operating systems to make everything work. And that is super cool.

## HOW TO SETUP
Clone and go into `reponame` directory.
Then,
```
$ docker-compose-up
```
