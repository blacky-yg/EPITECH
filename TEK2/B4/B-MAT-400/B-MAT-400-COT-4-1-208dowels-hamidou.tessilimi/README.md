# 208dowels

## DESCRIPTION

> A power hammer mass produces dowels. Sometimes, some pieces are defective, and the whole process requires quality control: 100 samples of 100 pieces are randomly taken, and defective pieces are numbered. We get what we call an observed serial. Then, a statistical fit is done using the binomial distribution,
and validated using the Ï‡ 2 test
