# 209poll

## DESCRIPTION

> Several months before an important election, many polls seem to pop up from nowhere. Their interpretations are often surrounded by uncertainty: to what extent are these polls reliable? Why are there so many differences between poll institutes? And from day to day? Is a 3% variation significant? etc...

> The goal of this project is to compute the 95% and 99% confidence intervals.
