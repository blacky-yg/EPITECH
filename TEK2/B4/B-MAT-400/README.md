# B-MAT-400 | Probablilty and Statistics Unit

## UNIT DESCRIPTION

> This unit is the continuation of the units from B1 and B2. The skills required to validate the first two units need to have been acquired. You must be able to create algorithms by using mathematical methods, and be at ease with graphic tools (plotting different kinds of curves).

## TOPICS TO BE COVERED

The unit consists of two sections: 5 probability classes and 5 statistics classes. 
- 1° Probability: random experience, events, probabilité, random variables and a few famous discrete or continuous variable laws. 
- 2° Statistics: descriptive statistics, statistic adjustments, correlation, survey sampling.

## SKILLS TO BE ACQUIRED

1° mastery of more complex scientific computing algorithms (formula decoding, combinatorial computing analysis, without intermediate storage in memory...)
2° ability to manage complicated numerical calculations, which requires a good, preexisting comprehension and intelligent implementation (descriptive statistics parameters, correlation parameters, expected value and variance with numerical integration...). 

You must be familiar with the fundamentals of probability and master several classic statistics methods. 
You will be evaluated through the completion of 10 mini-projects.
