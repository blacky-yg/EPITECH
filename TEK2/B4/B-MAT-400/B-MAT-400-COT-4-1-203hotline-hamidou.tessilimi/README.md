# 203hotline

## DESCRIPTION

> The random variable representing the number of people calling at a given time follows the binomial distribution, with calls being independent from each other. You’re also thinking about estimating the binomial ditribution with a Poisson distribution, so it can be used on a larger scale.

- Your first task is to compute the binomial coefficient and stack optimization).

- Your second task is to compare the binomial and Poisson distributions, given the average duration of calls, by printing:

• the probabilities of getting n simultaneous calls (for n increasing from 0 to 50),
• the probability of an overload,
• the computation time.

## Prerequisites
What do you need to install ?
```bash
python3.8
```

## USAGE
Type `./203hotline -h` to display help
```bash
./203hotline [n k | d]
```
