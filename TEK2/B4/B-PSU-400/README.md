# B-PSU-400 (Unix Prog - Memory)

## UNIT DESCRIPTION

Next installment of the first year's UNIX system programming unit. All projects are to be exclusively done in C/UNIXX (given that it's the next installment of the 1st year's PSU), except when explicitly stated otherwise in the subject:

In order to validate this unit, you must show, through your project, that you have acquired the following skills: 

- Understanding of the mechanisms of memory management 
  (in particular the links between physical memory and virtual memory); 
- Understanding of the structure of a binary(ELF) file format 

## SKILLS TO BE ACQUIRED
