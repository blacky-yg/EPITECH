# B-OOP-400 | Oriented Object Programming

## UNIT DESCRIPTION

> The second year C++ course will introduce you to the Object Oriented Programming paradigm.

## TOPICS TO BE COVERED

> We will discuss modularization and problematic' abstraction by using practical examples such as dynamic libraries.

## SKILLS TO BE ACQUIRED

1. PARADIGM SHIFT
turning-in projects without non-justified C code (excluding libc, C-style casts)

2. MODULARIZATION
use of class to separate the projects into several parts that are LOGICAL and COHERENT.

3. ABSTRACTION AND GENERIC PROGRAMMING
use of polymorphism through inheritance in order to factorize common code and for more genericity.
