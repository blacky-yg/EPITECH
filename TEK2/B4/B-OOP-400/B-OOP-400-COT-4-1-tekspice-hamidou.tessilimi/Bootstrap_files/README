I - GENERAL
-----------

	These code examples are designed to introduce C++ by the need for object-
	-oriented programs.

	There are 7 steps, organized in directories named "stepX/". Steps are:
	-Step 1 : Dumb, non-generic C list
	-Step 2 : Generic C list
	-Step 3 : Generic C list, written with object-like syntax
	-Step 4 : Dumb generic C++ list, using void*/length couples as content
	-Step 5 : More effective C++ list, using polymorphic items
	-Step 6 : Generic C++ chain list template with basic functionalities
	-Step 7 : STL std::list sample use

II - DOCUMENTATION
------------------

	Each step's headers are documented with Doxygen.

	To generate the documentation, simply type "make doc" in the root directory
	or a stepX directory. The documentations are located in each step's "doc/"
	subdirectory.

	Depending on your doxygen configuration, you may have to separately build
	the LaTeX part of the documentation, located in doc/latex.

	An HTML documentation will be generated in doc/html.

	Note that you HAVE to have a "doxygen" executable installed to build
	the documentation.

III - BUILDING THE EXAMPLES
---------------------------

	You can build all examples at once (using the Makefile in the root dir),
	or separately (using the Makefiles in the stepX/ directories).

	By default, "make" builds a test executable, executes it, and builds
	a "demo" excutable if the tests succeeded.
	The "demo" executable is what interests you.

	Makefile rules:
	---------------

	Rule: all
	Action: Builds the tests, runs them, then builds the "demo" executable

	Rule: clean
	Action: Removes the object files

	Rule: fclean
	Action: Invokes clean, and removes executables and documentation

	Rule: re
	Action: Invokes fclean then all

	Rule: doc
	Action: Invokes doxygen to make the documentation in "doc/" subdir.

IV - FEEDBACK
-------------

	These sample codes may include mistakes. If you notice one, please mail
	koala@epitech.net and we'll correct the code as soon as possible.

	Thanks for your help !
