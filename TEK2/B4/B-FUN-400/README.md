# B-FUN-400 (Functional Programming)

## UNIT DESCRIPTION

> Functional programming is a paradigm of programming that focuses on algorithms. In other words, it focuses on the evaluation of functions and the limits of the technical effects. We define a technical effect as something which modifies a function's execution environment. For example, a global affectation or writing on the standard output. In this way, in functional programming, we let the compiler handle the memory, the allocations and the code optimizations, which allows us to focus on the algorithms. 

> Functional programming and imperative programming are complementary. This is why properly mastering both paradigms will make you a better developer, one who is able to adapt to virtually any programming language. Furthermore, functional programming is a fundamental component of numerous other paradigms, like reactive programming.

> This way of programming, often unfamiliar and unfairly considered to be "too complicated" or "too detached from the reality of programming", is, in fact, a boon for a programmer's knowledge. 

> There are numerous functional languages, which encourage this way of programming, like Haskell, OCaml, Scala, Erlang ou F#... it's a long list.  A number of imperative languages, like C++, Swift and JavaScript, now incorporate functional parts.

> You will use Haskell, which has the huge quality of being a genuinely functional language, and offers a very comprehensive standard library and numerous external libraries. 

> You will find a lot of information about Haskell at the following address: http://haskell.org

## SKILLS TO BE ACQUIRED

In order to pass this unit, you must show sufficient master of the Haskell language and functional programming in general. This will take place with a precision learning phase, thanks to the statically typed system.  This precision will then save you an enormous amount of time in your C or C++ developments, which do not benefit from strong typing. 

For this unit, you will have to complete 2 mini-projects and 2 bootstraps.

Skills:
- Recursive functions
- Lists
- Pattern matching and pattern guards
- Partial application
- Modules
- Project management with Stack
- Input/Output
- Monads
