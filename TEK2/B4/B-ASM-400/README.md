# B-ASM-400

## UNIT DESCRIPTION

Presentation of the x86-64 Assembly and the use of this low-level language for the development of a minimalistic C library.

The different covered subjects:

- the x86-64 processor and its instruction set ;

- memory and stack operation ;

- address spaces and function calling ;

- development of a mini-LibC in Assembly.

## SKILLS TO BE ACQUIRED

x86-64 assembly knowledge that is sufficient enough for you to write small applications in assembler (mandatory for the upcoming security unit) as well as the ability to disassemble compiled programs.
