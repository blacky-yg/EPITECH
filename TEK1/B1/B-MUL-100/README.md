# B-MUL-100

## UNIT DESCRIPTION

The graphical programming consists in creating images/animations and scenes management using algorithms and graphical resources.

This unit aims to initiate you into this domain and, in a medium run, to prepare yourself to the main issues of the MyRPG, which is the main project of this unit at the end of the year. 
The two important axis of such a project are:
1 - Graphical special effects generation, 2D/3D rendering, collision management, entity management, etc. being part of the mathematical component.
2 - Gameplay, animations with sprites, virtual world coherence, lifespan of the game, etc. everything enhancing the "game" aspect.

Before each project, you can choose to pick the gaming or mathematical project. Multiple and distinct projects will be proposed accordingly.
To be clear, you are not forced to select all gaming or all mathematical projects, you can switch your focus between the projects.

For the first unit, the projects of the mathematics axis are:
- MyScreensaver: Animations based on light or any visual effects and using particles.
- MyRadar: Collision detection between a large number of flying planes within a 2D space.
and those in the game axis are:
- MyHunter: Game with a fixed camera, in which the player can shoot in some moving elements.
- MyRunner: Game with a scrolling camera in which the character must stay, while dodging obstacles.

Throughout the year, you will use the CSFML, a multimedia librairie developped in C.

For any question, feel free to check out "MUL 2023" on Yammer.
