# B-CPE-101

## UNIT DESCRIPTION

The C Pool is the foundation of the Epitech curriculum.

This is the second part of the pool.

- Also, in order to avoid losing your rhythm over the first week-end, a stumper (a project to do with a group of 2 in a very very small amount of time and without external help).
