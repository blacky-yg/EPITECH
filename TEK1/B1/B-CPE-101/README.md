# B-CPE-101

## UNIT DESCRIPTION

The C Pool is the foundation of the Epitech curriculum.

This is the second part of the pool.

ON THE AGENDA:
- the notorious Bistromatic, separated in multiple steps.
- Also, in order to avoid losing your rhythm over the first week-end, a stumper (a project to do with a group of 2 in a very very small amount of time and without external help).

This unit is important because it serves as a bridge between the first part of the pool, with new tasks each days, and the rest of your scolarship at Epitech.

## SKILLS TO BE ACQUIRED

- Be able to do a correct delivery

- Be able to do a working project

- Be able to do a functional project (in the Epitech's meaning)

- Algorithms capable of doing mathematical operations on infinite numbers

- Do a simple parser to evaluate a mathematical expression (evalexpr)

- Be able to do a simple project by yourself in restricted amount of time (stumper)

- Produce your first real working project (bistromatic)
