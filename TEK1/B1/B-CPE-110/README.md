# B-CPE-110

## UNIT DESCRIPTION

In a variety of ways, this unit will train you in (and allow you to practice the basics of) programming and problem analysis and the division and rigorous implementation that they demand.

This unit is comprised of two mini-project.

This unit covers classic programming aspects such as simple data structures arrays, linked lists, stacks) in different scenarios (data sorting, identifying holes in grid maps)

## SKILLS TO BE ACQUIRED

-Be capable of showing accuracy: reading a subject correctly, coding within the Norms in order to have a clear and logical division of projects, following the rendering’s instructions…

-Demonstrate the ability to correctly employ the language: syntax and simple data structures

-Demonstrate the ability to solve simple problems by using simple algorithms

-Make at least one functional rendering
