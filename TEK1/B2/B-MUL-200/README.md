# B-MAT-200

## UNIT DESCRIPTION

Graphical programming consists in creating images/animations and scenes management using algorithms and graphical resources.

This unit aim to go further into the skills in this domain and to synthetise your experience onto a final project: MyRPG
The two prior axis "mathematics" and "game" are still to be, but a new UX/UI-oriented aspect emerges.

Once again, you can choose your first project among two.
Note that from now on, the projects will be to do in groups.

For the second unit, the project of the mathematics axis is:
- MyWorld: Terraforming on a ground displayed from a isometric or parallal view.
and the one in the game axis is:
- MyCook: Development of a game whose goal is to manage a restaurant with an inventory and a skills tree.

The MyRPG project is the final project of the unit. The objective is to create a complete adventure game with a progressing experience.

Throughout the year, you will be provided the CSFML, a multimedia librairie developped in C.
