# B-MAT-200

## UNIT DESCRIPTION

This is the second part of the unit consecrated to mathematical tools. This unit is a complementary introduction to programmation (reviewing some of the Pool's elements), and is also an introduction to scientific programming.

This unit is the continuation of the B1 - Mathematics unit.

THEMES COVERED :
1° Numerical sequences and functions
2° Functional tools : derivatives, integration and their numerical implementations.

## SKILLS TO BE ACQUIRED

You should be proficient in basic mathematical tools such as: polynomals, function curves, sequences, derivatives, integration etc.
You should be able to intelligently and clearly implement scientific algorithms.

Each project includes a certain number of skills to be acquired.

You will be graded on the following:
- the number of skills validated
- the quality of Pitch presentations
- accuracy
